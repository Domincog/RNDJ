Your workshops really opened my eyes to the importance of diversity.
I appreciate the focus on community engagement in your sessions.
More resources for understanding equity in the workplace would be helpful.
The tools provided were enlightening; can you offer more advanced topics?
I feel more included in workplace discussions since attending your training.
It would be great to see more follow-up on the initiatives discussed.
The feedback mechanisms employed were very effective; thank you!
Could you organize networking events for attendees to share experiences?
I loved the interactive components of your workshops!
More emphasis on leadership roles in diversity would be beneficial.
Can you provide examples of successful equity initiatives from other businesses?
The materials shared during the workshop were very informative; more please!
How about implementing a mentoring program as part of your initiative?
Feel free to reach out again; I got a lot from these sessions!
More visual aids during presentations would enhance understanding.
The session on unconscious bias was eye-opening; thanks for that!
I wish more local businesses could collaborate with your organization.
Having a continuous dialogue platform could keep the momentum going!
I appreciate the cultural sensitivity that was included in the curriculum.
Can we have evening workshops for those of us who work during the day?
